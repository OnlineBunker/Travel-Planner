          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Travel Planner began as a spark between a group of college friends who shared one thing: a love for spontaneous adventures that rarely went as planned. Tired of juggling spreadsheets, screenshots, and ten open tabs just to organize a trip, we decided to create something better. What started as a late-night dorm room idea became our passion project — a digital space to plan, manage, and enjoy travel without the chaos. From solo treks to group getaways, Travel Planner simplifies the entire process, letting users focus on the fun, not the logistics. Built during our university journey, this platform reflects both our technical learning and our wanderlust. We’re still growing, still learning, and still exploring — and we hope you are too. Because every great trip starts with a plan… and ends with a story.</p>

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>At Travel Planner, our mission is to take the stress out of travel planning and put the joy back in. Whether you’re booking your first solo trip or coordinating a chaotic group vacation, our platform is designed to keep things simple, beautiful, and smart. We believe that good travel starts with good tools — ones that are intuitive, collaborative, and actually helpful. That’s why we’ve built features like shared itineraries, interactive maps, budget tracking, and destination insights, all in one place. But beyond the tech, we aim to foster a community of curious explorers who see travel not just as a break, but as a way to grow, learn, and connect. Our mission is to empower people to go farther, plan better, and remember more — all while keeping it fun and stress-free. Because the world is waiting, and so is your next adventure.</p>

          <h2>The Team</h2>
          <p>Travel Planner was built by a group of university students who share a passion for both travel and technology. What started as a simple idea during a class project turned into a platform we’re genuinely proud of. Each of us brings a different strength — from design and development to user experience and creative direction — and together, we’ve built something that’s more than just a grade. This project reflects our teamwork, late-night efforts, and our shared belief that planning a trip should be as exciting as taking one. Though we’re still students, Travel Planner is our way of turning big ideas into real tools for real people — and we’re only just getting started.</p>
