Ranging from 2,875 to 4,425 meters in elevation, this trek offers stunning views of the Himalayan landscape and charming hamlets below.

Mcleodganj serves as the trek's starting point and a popular hill station known for its serene Himalayan atmosphere and rich Buddhist culture. It's well-connected by bus, with the nearest airport being Kangra Airport (20 km away), and the nearest railway station being Amb Andaura (65 km from McLeodganj). Himachal Pradesh truly shines during this trek, covering a 35 km distance and offering an invigorating experience amidst high mountain passes, peaks, valleys, and dense forests. The Indrahar Pass, at 4,324 feet above sea level, attracts trekkers worldwide. The diverse altitudes along the trail reveal a panoramic splendor of various forests, and reaching the summit provides an unparalleled sense of accomplishment. The best time to visit is September and October, when the weather is fantastic with minimal snowfall. Day temperatures in October range from 12°C to 18°C, with nights cooling to -6°C to 4°C.
